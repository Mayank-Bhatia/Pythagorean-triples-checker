# Pythagorean-triples-checker

Is your triangle right-angled?
Welcome to the Pythagorean Triples Checker. Enter three natural numbers (eg. 3, 4, 5) separated by commas. This simple program checks to see whether your choice of three side-lengths (the natural numbers) are able to form a right-angled triangle. 

In this case, because 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2, we have made Pythagoras very happy (he probably doesn't care).
